<h1 id="cov-let-1">Covering Letter 1</h1>
<p> To me, loser is the one who loses hope of winning tomorrow.
 Who always looks at the negativity around him, 
 and blames others for his failure. Failure in one area means you can win in other one, 
 because the aptitude you are blessed with his different from what you are trying for. 
 However if one is dedicated enough this also doesn't matter, I mean your inherent ability or aptitude can be developed,
 provided you dedicate your soul ,mind and heart into something. Therefore to me loser is the one who curses himself and 
 considers himself incapable of doing something. One needs to try hard to get something , earlier there were lesser number
 of people and demand was less, now competition has increased many folds, due to various factors like growth in population,
 increased globalisation, literacy, and changed way of life ,therefore we need to try more than once to get something that 
 we aimed at or desperately need.Instead of doing that if you consider your unsuccessful attempt as losing something you are a loser. 
 As Swami Vivekananda put it “Weekness is death and strength is life”. Therefore loser is the one who considers himself weak.</p><hr>
